# ProductStore 🛒

**ProductStore** is a full-stack web application built with the **MERN stack**:  
- **MongoDB** for the database  
- **Express.js** for the backend framework  
- **React** for the frontend  
- **Node.js** as the runtime environment  

The project demonstrates a modern product management/storefront solution, featuring a responsive frontend and scalable backend API.
